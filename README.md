### 📅 Day 11 – Keywords & Scenario-Based Programming
*(Date: 29-Dec-2025)*

# 📘 Topics Covered
- Learned and implemented important Java keywords:

  - this – to refer to current class instance variables and methods.
  - static – to define class-level variables and methods.
  - final – to restrict modification of variables, methods, and classes.
    
- Understood differences between:

  - this vs static
  - Instance members vs static members
  - Final variables vs non-final variables
- Solved scenario-based problems to strengthen real-world understanding:

  - Parking Lot Management System
  - Phone Recharge Simulation
  - Number Guessing Game
  - Discount Calculation System
 
    
- Focused on:

  - Logical flow building
  - Conditional statements (if-else, switch)
  - Looping constructs
  - Clean and readable code structure
- Improved debugging skills and code readability.
