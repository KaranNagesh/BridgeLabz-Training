### 📅 Day 11 – Keywords & Scenario-Based Programming
*(Date: 29-Dec-2025)*

# 📘 Topics Covered
- Learned and implemented important Java keywords:

  - this – to refer to current class instance variables and methods.
  - static – to define class-level variables and methods.
  - final – to restrict modification of variables, methods, and classes.
    
- Understood differences between:

  - this vs static
  - Instance members vs static members
  - Final variables vs non-final variables
- Solved scenario-based problems to strengthen real-world understanding:

  - Parking Lot Management System
  - Phone Recharge Simulation
  - Number Guessing Game
  - Discount Calculation System
 
    
- Focused on:

  - Logical flow building
  - Conditional statements (if-else, switch)
  - Looping constructs
  - Clean and readable code structure
- Improved debugging skills and code readability.

### Day 12 – Scenario-Based Design & Object Modeling
*(Date: 30-Dec-2025)*

# 📘 Topics Covered
- Practiced real-world scenario-based problem solving using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

- Learned how to identify entities, attributes, and relationships from problem statements.

- Designed and implemented object models before writing code.

- Understood and applied different types of relationships:

  - Association – objects related but independent
  - Aggregation – “has-a” relationship with independent lifecycles
  - Composition – strong ownership and dependency
  - Key Concepts Applied

- Breaking real-world problems into:
  - Classes
  - Objects
  - Responsibilities
- Mapping real-life scenarios into:

  - Class diagrams (conceptual understanding)
  - Logical method responsibilities
