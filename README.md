### 📅 Day 13 – Inheritance & Types of Inheritance in Java
*(Date: 31-Dec-2025)*

# 📘 Topics Covered
- Learned the concept of Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming:

  - Reusing properties and behaviors of an existing class.
  - Promoting code reusability and logical hierarchy.
  - Understanding the extends keyword.
 
    
- Explored different types of inheritance supported in Java:

  - Single Inheritance – One child class inherits from one parent class.
  - Multilevel Inheritance – A class derived from another derived class.
  - Hierarchical Inheritance – Multiple subclasses inherit from a single parent class.
  - Multiple Inheritance (via Interfaces) – Achieved using interfaces since Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes.
  - Hybrid Inheritance (conceptual) – Combination of multiple and multilevel inheritance using interfaces.
- Practiced usage of:

  - super keyword to access parent class constructors and methods.
  - Method overriding and runtime polymorphism.
  - Accessing inherited members based on access modifiers.
- Implemented real-world examples such as:

  - Person → Waiter → Chef hierarchy
  - Vehicle → Electrical Vehicle
  - Student → Teacher → Staff
